 # Job Market Analysis Using Salary Data

A Tableau-powered interactive dashboard that visualizes global salary trends across job titles, experience levels, employment types, and company sizes. This project helps users gain insight into compensation patterns across roles and regions, empowering smarter career and hiring decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores a curated Kaggle dataset containing job titles, compensation, experience levels, company sizes, and more. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and represent them through compelling Tableau visualizations.

Built using:  
- **Data Source**: Kaggle Job Salary Data  
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau  
- **Skills Used**: Data Cleaning, ETL, Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Analytics Storytelling

## 🎯 Objective

To decode how compensation varies by:
- Job title  
- Experience level  
- Employment type  
- Company size and location  

…and present these insights in a visually intuitive way to aid:
- Job seekers exploring global roles  
- Recruiters benchmarking salary offers  
- Researchers studying job market dynamics  

## ⚙️ Implementation

After preprocessing the data to clean outliers, standardize job titles, and convert salaries to a common currency, we built the following visualizations:

- **Side-by-Side Circles**: Salary vs employment type and experience  
- **Top 10 Job Titles**: Highest-paying roles globally  
- **Donut Charts**: Company size & experience level breakdowns  
- **World Map**: Geographic salary distribution  
- **Job Title Explorer**: Filterable list by role and level  
- **Salary by Experience Type**: Comparative insights

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Full-time roles show the highest average salaries  
- Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists top the pay chart  
- Large companies dominate North America; startups thrive in remote roles  
- Geographic trends suggest relocation opportunities for higher pay  

## 🚧 Challenges

- Currency standardization for global comparisons  
- Handling outliers without skewing results
